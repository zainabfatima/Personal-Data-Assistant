🤖 Personal LLM Data Assistant

A **personalized AI assistant** that can read, understand, and answer questions about **your own documents and datasets** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
It combines **LangChain**, **OpenAI GPT models**, and **vector databases** to give you context-aware answers from your local data.

 Features

* 📂 **Document Ingestion** – Upload PDFs, TXT, or CSV files for analysis.
* 🧹 **Text Processing** – Automatic text cleaning and chunking for better retrieval.
* 🧠 **Vector Search** – Store embeddings in a vector database for semantic search.
* 💬 **LLM-Powered QA** – Use GPT-based models to answer questions about your files.
* 🔍 **Semantic Retrieval** – Finds the most relevant text chunks for your query.
* 🌐 **Streamlit Interface** – Clean and interactive web-based UI.

1. **Document Loading** – Uses libraries like `PyPDF2` and `pandas` to read files.
2. **Chunking** – Splits large documents into smaller overlapping chunks using LangChain’s `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
3. **Embedding** – Converts chunks into numerical vectors via `OpenAIEmbeddings`.
4. **Vector Storage** – Saves vectors in **FAISS** for fast semantic search.
5. **Query Processing** – When you ask a question, it:

   * Searches FAISS for the most relevant chunks
   * Sends them to GPT-3.5 or GPT-4
   * Returns a concise, context-based answer.

📤 Input

* `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.csv` files containing your personal or project data.
